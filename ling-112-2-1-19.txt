dislike, V, __ NP

procedure for building a sentence
(1) structure building. use our grammar rules
(2) lexical insertion. Insert words from our lexicon paying attention to the syntactic restriction. ex. rug, V dave, Name to, P

sub-categorization requirements are not defining the word itself but instead what is around the word.

The brackets mean that PP must be what is the PP
rely, V, __ PP[on]

relational nouns are nouns that can be followed by of with another NP following that
RN -> of -> NP

ocean, N, __(PP[of])

the sub cat rules are the wastebasket of Syntax
they are where you put things that cant be generalized

with our current PP rule there is not optionality so we dont need to do
  to, P, __ NP

the brackets mean that PP must be what is the PP
rely, V, __ PP[on]
compliments are always to the right.


used as modifiers. PPs can be swapped with each other in this case
NP -> NP PP

these are always modifiers
-Location
-times
-causes
-attributes

these PP can not be recursive or swapped with other PP. ex. prof. of physics
VP -> (NP)(AP)(PP)


sister of basic thing, N, V, are complements
sisters of groups, NP, VP, are modifiers


Auxilary verbs

only 3 verbs in a row


_______ |_____ |__ V
        |      |
might   |have  |be
could   |      |
should  |      |
may     |      |
        |      |
AUX3    |AUX2  |AUX1
each of these are their own lexical type

Form rules
AUX3 requires a bare verb after it EX. might be
AUX2 requires a -EN verb after it  EX. have been
AUX1 requires a -ING verb after it EX. be taking

so our rule would be

VP -> (AUX3)(AUX2)(AUX1)V(NP)(AP)(PP)

Most English verbs have six forms: three finite forms (present singular,
present plural, past) and three nonfinite forms (the bare form, the -ING form,
and the -EN form). Some examples are given below.

Pres. Sg. is/am    gives  rings   goes  talks   smiles  buys   brings   has
Pres. Pl. are      give   ring    go    talk    smile   buy    bring    have
Past      was/were gave   rang    went  talked  smiled  bought brought  had
Bare      be       give   ring    go    talk    smile   buy    bring    have
-ING      being    giving ringing going talking smiling buying bringing having
-EN       been     given  rung    gone  talked  smiled  bought brought  had


Most current class grammar as follows:

Our phrase structure rules are in (1):

(1)
    a. S→NP VP
    b. VP→(AUX3) (AUX2) (AUX1) V (NP) (AP) (PP)
    c. VP→VP (PP)← PPs for modifiers
    d. AP→(Deg) A (PP)← PPs added for complements
    e. PP→P NP
    f. NP→({D})
          ({PossP}) (AP) N (PP)← PPs added for complements
    g. NP→{Pro}
          {Name}
    h.  NP→NP PP← PPs stay for modifiers
    i. PossP →NP Poss

Our form rules are in (2), based on the term verbal element, which is defined in (3)

(2)

a.AUX3 rule:
Pleace the feature BARE on a verbal element immediately to the right of an AUX3.

b. AUX2 rule:
Pleace the feature EN on a verbal element immediately to the right of an AUX2.

c. AUX1 rule:
Pleace the feature ING on a verbal element immediately to the right of an AUX1.

(3)A verbal element is an element of the syntactic categories V, AUX1, AUX2, or AUX3.

Our derivational order is given in (4), with (4i) being the first step:

(4)The order of derivations
i.   structure building
ii.  lexical insertion
iii. form rules
iv.  spell out
