This is what i did for the homework. its not a transformation because it doesnt change the tree only the way we pronounce the words
Form rule: Ragnarok

In a tree of the form below

[TP
  [NP]
  [T'
    [T]
    [VP
      [
        ...
        [CP
          [C'
            [C for]
            [TP
              [NP]
              [T' ...]
            ]
          ]
        ]
      ]
    ]
  ]
]

Place a NULL feature on the embedded C and embedded subject
resulting in the tree below

[TP
  [NP]
  [T'
    [T]
    [VP
      [
        ...
        [CP
          [C'
            [C for_NULL]
            [TP
              [NP_NULL]
              [T' ...]
            ]
          ]
        ]
      ]
    ]
  ]
]

This is the transformation verion of the form rule I proposed
transformation: Ragnorok

In a tree of the form below

[TP
  [NP]
  [T'
    [T]
    [VP
      [
        ...
        [CP
          [C'
            [C for]
            [TP
              [NP]
              [T' ...]
            ]
          ]
        ]
      ]
    ]
  ]
]

remove the embedded C and embedded subject
resulting in the tree below

[TP
  [NP]
  [T'
    [T]
    [VP
      [
        ...
        [CP
          [C'
            [TP
              [T' ...]
            ]
          ]
        ]
      ]
    ]
  ]
]


With our knowledge we cant make any argument about why the we should use the form rule over the transformation rule.

the transformation rule violates the x' schema because by removing the C under out C' rule, we are removing a head. It violates the TP PSR rule because we remove the NP in TP -> NP T' which we say is required.

These matter only in the sense that we dont want to violate our X' schema because the x' schema is supposed to limit our transformations

      in our X' schema
      1. specifers are always on the left.
      2. complements are always on the right
      3. modifiers float on either side

for this class we will go with the transformation :(


(2) and (3) can be synominus depending on who you ask
(4) and (5) are not synominus

(2) Loki planned for himself to escape
(3) Loki planned for him to escape.

(4) Loki_i saw himself_i. "loki" and "himself" are coreferent, =
(5) Loki_i saw him_j.     "loki" and" him" have disjoint reference, =/ !=

we will use a subscript lower case letter on words that have reference.
so in (4) loki and himself both have i implying they are coreferent
and in (5) loki and him have different subscripts implying that are disjoint reference

we can use the curly braces with this subscript indicator for showing multiple sentences on one line

(6) Loki_i saw him_{*i,j} and himself_{i,*j,*k}

this opens up the question of in the deep structure of (1) Loki planned to escape is (2) or (7) loki planned for loki to escape.


now we can look at passive sentences and this transformation

(8) a. Heimdall planned for someone to invite him
    b. Heimdall planned for someone [to be invited]

(8a) is the deep structure of (8b)

Heimdall_i planned for someone_j to invite he_i     deep structure
Heimdall_i planned for he_i to be invited           passive transformation on CP
Heimdall_i planed to be invited                     transformation: Ragnarok
