transformation rules can affect NP as well as VP

SECTION:
Hypotheses 1:

1. Move PP sister of v to be the first daughter of S
2. Move NP daughter S immediately to the right of the V to be the sister of V

Step 2 is necessary if the verb normally requires something to follow it
such as verbs like be.

Hypotheses 2:

1. simultaneously move PP sister of V and NP daughter of S to each others side of the tree

Multipart transformation rules allow you to partially apply the rules like Hypotheses 1.
This allows you to limit the application of parts a rule to a specific subclass of verbs.
