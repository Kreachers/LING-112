When testing for if a PP is a modifier or a complement
always start with assuming it is a modifier and test if
you can swap places with another modifier.


proposed rule:
aux2:
place EN on the first V/AUX thats the daughter of the VP of that VP is following AUX2.

this works for all of our currect sentences we have go over.
it breaks down with sentences where the v/aux we need to change is after another v. Such as "Has the person who is reading their book been fishing?"

"the person who is reading their book" is a NP known as a relative clause.
we will go over relative clauses at a later date.

If a tree has the form AUX2 NP VP, place EN on the first verbal element in the VP.
this rule works much better.
