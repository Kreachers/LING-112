  Lets suppose there is an NP. That allows some sentences such as, (1) There is a cat on the mat, to be generated by our grammar. However it also allows non grammatical sentences to be generated such as (17) *There expired a license. This also doesn't account for all possible sentences with there in it like (8) There was a predatory bird eating a snake. We cant generate sentences like (8) because giving our current grammar we have no way of having a sentence start with more then one NP.

  assuming that there is an NP with the feature [TH] listed in the lexicon as there, NP[TH] we can create some new rules to allow sentences to generate starting with there. one possible route we could take is to create a new rule, (A) S -> {NP_[TH]} NP VP. using this rule we are able to generate grammatical sentences such as (8) There was a predatory bird eating a snake. however this also allows us to generate ungrammatical sentences such as (22) There the cat jumped on the chair or (23) there cars were driving by.


email Jed and ask if the way our current sentence rule S -> NP VP allows the there to fulfill the NP spot even if we assume there is an NP with the feature [TH] or if we need to specify the possibility of [TH] such as
    S -> NP_{[TH]} VP
also ask if the TA's perfer having the picture of the syntax tree or if they would perfer to have the bracket notation. And if I did use the brackets notation would they like me to have it all on one line or if it would be better to have it spread out where each element is on its own line.
