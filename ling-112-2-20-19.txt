when you have both the AUX -be and main verb be in a sentence you put the NP in between them.


3 There topicalization
10 Therifization
3 There NP transformation
5 Greg


sentences 1-7 are sentences we can currently generate with our grammar.
Therifization doesnt like when the NP is a NAME, PRONOUN, and NP starting with D

deep structure for 10
Structure building and Lexical insertion

[S
  [NP
    [NAME Lee]
  ]
  [VP
    [AUX-be was]
    [V invited]
    [PP
      [P to]
      [NP
        [D the]
        [N party]

recreateing the tree without lexical insertion


[S
  [NP
    [NAME_[3rd, sg] Lee]
  ]
  [VP
    [AUX-be_[+past, 3rd, sg] was]
    [V_[ing] inviting]
    [PP
      [P to]
      [NP
        [D the]
        [N party]
      ]
    ]
  ]
]

and that gives us
*Lee was inviting to the party

which isn't 10 and is also ungrammatical.

looking at each of the sentences we can notice the verbs following AUX-be arent having the form rules applied properly.

we also notice that we have verbs that both require a NP and require there to not be an NP. some of the verbs like invited require the subject to be the inviter and the object to the the invitee. and at the same time the subject is the invitee in a different context.
we dont want to create a lot of different subcat rules like below

admire,V, __ NP

subject= admirer
object= admiree

admire,V, __ (PP)

subject= admiree

not all verbs are like this like sleep and arrived.

    ]
  ]
]

given the structure for 3 in order to get to 10 we have to have a transformation

step 1:
get rid of subject

[S

  [VP
    [V invited]
    [NAME Lee]
    [PP
      [P to]
      [NP
        [D the]
        [N party]
      ]
    ]
  ]
]

step 2:
Move NP object to subject postiaion of S

[S
  [NP
    [NAME Lee]
  ]
  [VP
    [V invited]
    [PP
      [P to]
      [NP
        [D the]
        [N party]
      ]
    ]
  ]
]

step 3:
Add AUX-be in VP in from on main V

[S
  [NP
    [NAME Lee]
  ]
  [VP
    [AUX-be be]
    [V invited]
    [PP
      [P to]
      [NP
        [D the]
        [N party]
      ]
    ]
  ]
]

this is almost right
we got the wrod order right
the syntax right

we dont have the tense and verb agreement right

we will talk more about this next class
