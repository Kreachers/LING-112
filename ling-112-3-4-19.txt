(1) [People wondered] whether [the grass was wet]
(2) [Everyone believed] that [the child was missing]

[People wondered] [the grass was wet] [the child was missing] each can stand alone as sentences

[Everyone believed] in this context is not a sentence.

they would appear similar to conjuctions but works when they cant stand alone.

it looks like  [the child was missing] and [the grass was wet] are complements of the verbs in their sentences

(3) a. Everyone believed that the child was missing and that the grass was wet.
    b. *Everyone believed that the child was missing and that the grass was wet.

(4) a. he motivated the class
    b. he motivated me
    c. *he motivated the class me
    d. he motivated me and the class

if we tried to swap that for whether adn vise verse we run into ungrammatical sentences. this goes to show that we need sub cat rules to prevent that from happening. we can only have subcat rules for complements.

(5) a. it surprised everyone that the crowd was enormous.
    b. *it surprised everyone {that enormous crould}
                             {the size of the crowd}
    c. {that enormous crown}  surprised everyone
       {the size of the crow}


(6) people wonder {when} the child went missing
                  {how}
                  {where}
                  {why}
                  what went missing

if we remove people wonder we get questions without did



wonder,   V, __ CP[C_I]
believed, V, __ CP[C_D]
motivate, V, __ NP
know,     V, __ CP

that,     C_D(declarative),
whether,  C_I(interrogative),
if,       C_I(interrogative),

C-drop rule
C_D can get a NUll, circle with line through it, feature
C_D -> C_D,NULL

our new rules

CP -> C S
VP -> V (NP) (AP) (PP) (CP)


from section we discovered the N' pronounced N bar can be written with a bar over the N
its the inbetween steps of and N and an NP

ex. NP -> D N'
    N' -> N (PP)
    N' -> N' (PP)

X = head
YP = complement
WP = adjunct/ modifier
ZP = specifier


if you move an XP it better move to a specifier.

b. I will ask which apple the mother would devour.
b'.I will ask the mother would devour which apple
c. The mother will devours the apple.
c'. the mother will devour

devour, V, __NP

which apple probably originated as the sister of devour

and given that the mother would devout the apple is a sentence we must have a CP
