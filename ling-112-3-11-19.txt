We need a AUX-pass form rules
Place EN on the verbal element head of a VP complement of AUX-Pass



Th[ey]_i [are]_j invited
someone invit[es]_j th[em]_i

this is why we have the passive transformation before form rules. the form of
the main verb and the object change depending on if the sentence is passive or
accusative.

someone is      watching  him
he  is      being     watched
NP  AUX-be AUX-Pass  VP


------------------------

agent theme and goal describe the relationship between things.

agent is like the doer/intentional

john walks

john is doing the walking


theme is the undergoer

mary fell

falling is happening to mary
she not intentionally falling


goal is the recipient

Sam sent a letter to jim

sam is the agent
a letter is the theme
jim is the goal

jim is getting the theme
sam is doing the sending
a letter is getting sent

you can have a goal without a theme

sam donated to charity
and
sam donated money to charity

walk, V, <A>
fall, V, <T>
send, V, <A,T,G>

#the redwoods voted.

voted wants a agent and instinctively the redwoods are a goal.
