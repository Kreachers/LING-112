ignoring modifiers our current x' schema is
XP -> [specifier] X'
X' -> X [complement]

XP's with specifiers

TP -> NP T'
NP -> ({D, PossP}) N'
AP -> (Deg) A'

Xp's currently without specifiers

VP -> V'
PP -> P'
CP -> C'

(1) John has left

[TP
  [NP
    [Name John]
  ]
  [T'
    [T_+PAST,-NEG]
    [VP
      [V'
        [AUX-have have]
        [VP
          [V'
            [V_EN leave]
          ]
        ]
      ]
    ]
  ]
]

WE dont have the rule that take the features of the T and apply it to the next V
our rule now is to move the first V head into T head

so far T bears the features of 1st/2nd/3rd person, and single/plural from the subject and  +-PAST, -+NEG, of the verb.

So after applying out AUX moving transformation


[TP
  [NP
    [Name John]
  ]
  [T'
    [T_+PAST,-NEG
      [AUX-have had]
    ]
    [VP
      [V'
        [VP
          [V'
            [V_EN leave]
          ]
        ]
      ]
    ]
  ]
]

We know that T gets the +PAST and -NEG is because we are trying to form the sentence John had left so we have to look are the sentence to know what tense
it doesnt matter what else it could generate. we could generate the the present tense but that doesnt matter to us.


dialect is about communities language commonly defined as spacial but sometimes racial or class or more commonly between games or online communities

ideolect is personal effectively dialect


(2) John left.

[TP
  [NP
    [Name John]
  ]
  [T'
    [T_+PAST,+NEG]
    [VP
      [VP
        [V'
          [V leave]
        ]
      ]
    ]
  ]
]

[TP
  [NP
    [Name John]
  ]
  [T'
    [T leave_+PAST,+NEG]
    [VP
      [VP
        [V'
        ]
      ]
    ]
  ]
]

(2') *John leftn't

the problem with doing this is it opens us up to a sentence like (2')

a. one possiblity is that we have a silent do hidden but we wont explore that idea.

b. another is we have a transformation rule where before we move something other then and AUX verb into the T head we insert do into the T head. and because do doesnt add any meaning to the sentence we are able to insert it without worry.

there is never a reason to have negation on the main verb.


c. another possibility is to have some sort of x' schema specifically for negation. will explore more at a future date.

d. there is a form rule specifically for when there is negation and another when there isnt negation.

ASK TO EXPLAIN IN MORE DETAIL I DONT FOLLOW

---------last homework-------------------

ASK ABOUT C_H AND HOW I THOUGHT FOR COULD NOT HAVE TO FOLLOW IT
WOULDNT THE HEAD OF A TP BE THE NP/NAME NOT THE T

(3) a. John planned [for [mary to visit him]]
                    CP   TP
    b. John planned that mary would visit him.
    c. *John planned for mary would visit him.
    d. *John planned that mary to visit him.

[TP[T]]

for, C, __ TP[to]
to, T/AUX-mod,
that, C, __ TP[-to]

we can only argue in subcat for what the head is therefore to must be a T and it is infinitive meaning it is not finite so it has no tense

therefore our subcat rule would look like

for, C, __ TP[-fin]
to, T_-fin,
that, C, __ TP[+finite]
