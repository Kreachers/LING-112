D and Poss cant occur at the same time.
they both ocupy the same spot.
they both describe a NP
They have the same limits

cant have AP NP Poss because and NP has to be between a N and a Poss

some parts of speech can occupy the same spot where you have to choose one of the other. usually syntactitions do like below but where instead of bracket on each line its one large bracket covering all three lines. for our class we will do something like below.

      {D}
NP -> {NP Poss}
      {something else}
