--------------------SECTION NOTES-----------------------------------------------

pretend wh words like who or what are noun phrases

can we generate these sentences?

1. who is wearing 5 inch stiletos?
2. who has been doing?
3. who sings backstreet boys in korean?
4. who has a cat?

yes but there is actually string transformation, its just string vacuous movement.

5. could she have been looking for her child?
6. could they have been going at it?
7. is out family having a reunion?
8. is syntax difficult?
9. *does syntax be difficult?
10. *do syntax be difficult?
11. *has she some money?
12. does she have some money?
13. *do she has some money?
14. *does he the dishes?
15. does he do the dishes?
16. do he does the dishes?

Deep structure of 5 including form rules:
  She could have been looking for her child.
The transformation just moves the first aux to the front


deep structure of 8 after form rules:
  syntax is difficult
the difference here is the words "be/is" is a main verb and not an aux verb


Nora's hypothesis

  change our transformation from first aux to first verbal element

this over generates cause sentences like 9

My and noras hypothesis

  more the first aux or if there is no aux verb then move main verb be

this is better but not great.

noras new hypothesis

  add do to the front of the sentences


-----

looking at sentence 11 and 12

she has some money
she does have some money

we need to add a new transformation that adds do as the first AUX.
then the hypothesis me and nora came up with works just fine.

P-Q transformations

theres an order that need to be followed here.

1. insert do if theres no AUX's
2. move first AUX or main verb be if there are no AUX's


WH questions

now consider sentences like

17. what will i be wearing tomorrow?
18. what have i been doing with my life?
19. what does he sing in karaoke?


we asserted earlier who and what are NP's
