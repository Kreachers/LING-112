Constituents are a group of words in a tree that are all under the same branch.

NOTE: plug trees A and B into the online syntax tree site to get a visual

Using the sentence The woman in the back row
So in A the possible constituents are as follows:
1.  in the back row
2.  the woman in the back row
3.  behind the woman in the back row
4.  the performer behind the woman in the back row

A
[NP
  [NP The performer]
  [PP
    [P behind]
    [NP
      [NP the woman]
      [PP
        [P in]
        [NP the back row]
      ]
    ]
  ]
]

So in B the possible constituents are as follows:
1.  the performer
2.  behind the woman
3.  the back row
4.  the performer behind the woman
5.  the performer behind the woman the back row

B
[NP
  [NP
    [NP the performer]
    [PP
      [P behind]
      [NP the woman]
    ]
    [PP
      [P in]
      [NP the back row]
    ]
  ]
]

For tree A the logic goes as follows

performer is behind the woman and the woman is in the back row

*"in the back row" is modifying "the woman"
*"behind the woman in the back row" is modifying "the performer"

performer -> woman
              ^
          in the back row


For tree B the logic goes as follows:

The performer is in the back row and ins behind the woman

[[performer in back row] behind woman]

*"in the back row" is modifying "the performer behind the woman"
*"behind the woman" is modifying the performer


be careful when asking constituent questions. just delete words from the sentences and dont move words around other wise your testing a different sentence.

ambiguois. works for both trees logically
Q: who behind the woman in the back row shouted?
A: The performer.

unambigous only logically works with tree B
Q: who in the back row shouted?
A: the performer behind the woman.


if you replace "performer behind the woman" with "who"
who targets NP's

you can not replace "the woman in the back row" with who
with out restructuring the sentence which you can not do.
you create "islands"

you cant form certain questions without creating islands or rebuilding sentences.
