Lingusitics
What is going on in out heads when it comes to language. We can for principles when it comes to reason.
Pretty much everyone learns to speak fluently by 5.
We have a biological aptitude to language.
In this class we focus on Syntax, how we build sentences.
We will use English.
We will be creating a generative grammar and it will change through the structure.
It will generate all and only the well formed expressions of English.

idiolect: individual dialect
Technical terms for well formed(grammatical) and not well formed(ungrammatical)

grammatical: A sentence is a grammatical sentence of X language iff a native speaker judges it to be well formed
ungrammatical: A sentence is a grammatical sentence of X language iff a native speaker judges it to be not well formed

We call things infelicitous/anomalous if a sentence is well formed but doesnt make sense. ex sentence 5b

sentences 6 is ambiguous. it has multiple interpretations
