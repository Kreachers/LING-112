Phase structure rules
lexical insertion
transformation

determines word order. meaning is established in deep structure which is phase structure rule and lexical insertion. transformations just change word order.

form rules
are morphology

form rules cant make something ungrammatical. they only change how a word is pronounced not what it means.


creating a node in the deep structure with a feature is not the same as creating a transformation that says a node has a feature. The feature already having the feature in the deep structure effect the meaning of the sentence. a transformation applying a feature doesn't effect the meaning.

the first aux is special. it bears tense and is the only ting to the left of the negations.

there is a thing called ellipses that says you what you hear isnt always what you get.

Bill[might[have[been[talking[to him]]]]]

where you can pick a vp in the above "tree" and add the null, circle with line thgouh it, feature and then not pronounce it.

that is vp ellipses. it happens in english but not in alot of other languages

i dont think we will use this too much.
