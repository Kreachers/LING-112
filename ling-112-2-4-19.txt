The proper way to add the subscript BARE in our tree is it should look dislike
[V tree_[BARE]]

This is how you put brackets in the tree itself
[V tree_\[BARE\]]


TYPES OF SENTENCES
  declarative sentence: a statement(make a claim about the world)
  interrogative sentence: a question(requests information)
    - polar questions: yes-no questions
    - wh- questions: who what when where etc questions


DIFFERENCES BETWEEN QUESTIONS
what questions replace something in the sentence
yes no questions shift auxiliary verbs around from the VP to the beginning of the sentence.
At least with our current questions.

(4)
a. the boy could eat his dinner

b. could the boy eat his dinner?
c. what could the boy eat?
c'. *what could the boy eat his dinner?
d. where could the boy eat?
e. why could the boy eat his dinner?


YES/NO QUESTIONS

(1)should he leave?
(2)should he have left?
(3)should he be leaving?


AUX verbs can be separated from their verb groups and moved to the front.

we will ignore form rules for now.

possible correct layouts

AUX3 NP AUX2 AUX1 V
AUX3 NP AUX2      V
AUX3 NP      AUX1 V
AUX3 NP           V

AUX2 NP      AUX1 V
AUX2 NP AUX2      V

AUX1 NP           V

potential new rules

S-> AUX1 NP VP
S-> AUX2 NP VP
S-> AUX3 NP VP

these allow us to generate all our our yes/no questions
but it also allows us to generate ungrammatical questions (6)

(6) *should he should be leaving?
(7) *he should should be leaving?
(8) *should he should should be leaving?

MORE DIFFERENT RULES

S → AUX3 NP ?P
?P → (AUX2) (AUX1) V (NP) (AP) (PP)

this allows us to generate some question but not all.

we could create another rules

S → AUX1 NP ?P

this over generates. but it on the right track.


lets name our ?P and create more of them

S → AUX1 NP VP1
VP1 → V (NP) (AP) (PP)

S → AUX2 NP VP2
VP2 → (AUX1) V (NP) (AP) (PP)

S → AUX3 NP VP3
VP3 → (AUX2) (AUX1) V (NP) (AP) (PP)

SECTION

the rule that requires the next word to be BARE is a vacuous rule. it doesn't look like it has been applied but is has.


frames for aux verbs?
there arent very many in English. just memorize them


KEEP IN MIND FOR FUTURE HOMEWORKS

donald trolls the libs.
donald trolled the libs.

There is a hidden thing between donald and troll that effects their tense.
