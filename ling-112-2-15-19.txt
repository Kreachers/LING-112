Gabbis transformation

1. Find the initial AUX daughter of VP
2. Move that AUX to be the first daughter of S
3. ADD NP_[TH] as the first daughter of S


lets see how to generates some sentences

1. a. There should be a cat on the mat.
   b. There should a cat on the mat.

2. a. There is a boy running.
   b. There should be a boy running.



lets do gabbi's transformation

1. Find the initial AUX of VP
2. Move the AUX to be the first daughter of S
3. ADD NP_[TH] as the first daughter of S

start with our original tree and find the AUX verb and move it to the front of the S
this is the first 3 of our derivation steps
[S
  [NP_[3rd, single]
    [D a]
    [N boy]
  ]
  [VP
    [AUX-be_[3rd, single,+past] be]
    [V run_[ing]]
  ]
]

[S
  [AUX-be_[3rd, single,+past] be]
  [NP_[3rd, single]
    [D a]
    [N boy]
  ]
  [VP
    []<- doesnt mean anything just shows that the AUX was here
    [V run_[ing]]
  ]
]

Next step 3, add there on the front of the S:

[S
  [NP_[TH] There]
  [AUX-be_[3rd, single,+past] be]
  [NP_[3rd, single]
    [D a]
    [N boy]
  ]
  [VP
    [V run_[ing]]
  ]
]

this works for 2a. but doing this for 2b we get
*there should a boy be running.
which this is where this breaks down

we will see that There must be followed by all of the AUX verbs in the S.

there is two ways we can say this.

1. we move each of the AUX verbs moved to the front of the sentence
2. we move the NP to the other side of the AUX verbs


technical definitions

the subject of a sentence is the NP daughter of S
The object in a sentence is the NP complement of V in VP
the object of a preposition is the NP complement of P in PP

knowing this we can reword gabbis transformation

1. find the NP subject of S
2. move NP subject to be a daughter of VP immediately after AUX-be
3. ADD NP_[TH] as the first daughter of S


using this new transformation lets look at 2b

this is our deep structure
[S
  [NP_[3rd, single]
    [D a]
    [N boy]
  ]
  [VP
    [AUX-mod should_[3rd, single,+past]]
    [AUX-be be_bare]
    [V run_[ing]]
  ]
]

this is our shallow structure
[S
  [NP_[TH] There]
  [VP
    [AUX-mod should_[3rd, single,+past]]
    [AUX-be be_bare]
    [NP_[3rd, single]
      [D a]
      [N boy]
    ]
    [V run_[ing]]
  ]
]

you can see we removed our subject of our sentence and then added in a new one.


one of the flaws with this transformation is the its not just AUX-be its also main verb be. so when moving our subject you don't just move the NP after the AUX-be but also V be, which ever is first
