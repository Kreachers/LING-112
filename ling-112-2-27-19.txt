(5) a. I see john.
    b. John sees {*I, me}.

we can see in these sentences that we use a different form for our NP depending on if its the subject or the object.

we would show all the different forms for a pronoun in our lexicon but pronouns cant have a subcat frame because they cant have any sisters or more specifically no complements so there can be any subcat frame that dictate what its complement can or should be.

to dictate what form we use we need a form rule or two.

Nominative/subject form rule:

in a tree structured like below we add the NOM feature to the object of the tree or the NP daughter of the S

[S
  [NP
    [Pro_NOM]
  ]
  [VP]
]

Accusative/object form rule:

in a tree structured like below we add the ACC feature to the object of the tree or the NP daughter of the VP

[S
  [NP]
  [VP
    [V]
    [NP
      [Pro_Acc]
    ]
  ]
]


there is also a genitive form rule that we may or may not use in the futrue
where Null means you dont pronounce it
Genitive form rule

[PossP
  [NP
    [Pro_Gen]
  ]
  [Poss_Null]
]


(2') Have we been crying?
(3') Are we laughing?
(8) we cried?
(8') did we cry?
(8'') *cried we?

(9) we didnt cry.
(9') *we not cried.
(9'') *we not cry.
(9''') *we criedn't.

(10) we aren't laughing.
(11) we are not laughing.
(12) *we not are laughing.

(13) we havent been crying.
(14) *we have been not crying.

we can see in order to make a sentence negative we add a not or n't to the first aux

the first AUX really matters


it has tense
it is where negation must follow
